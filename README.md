#LangChain Hands on work
This is a simple example of using LangChain with the OpenRouter API to generate jokes using the Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

## Setup

1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain-openrouter langchain-core python-dotenv
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenRouter API key:
   ```plaintext
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will generate and print a joke about beets using the Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

You can change the topic of the joke by modifying the input in the `chain.invoke` method in `main.py`:

```python
result = chain.invoke({"topic": "your_topic_here"})
print("Gemini 2.5 Joke:", result)
```

If you want to give a topic as an input in CLI then

```python
topic = input("Enter a topic for the joke: ")
result = chain.invoke({"topic": topic})
```

## Result

The output will be a joke related to the specified topic, generated by the Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

Gemini 2.5 Joke: _(Leans into the mic, squints at the audience)_

Alright, so check this out. I'm trying to be healthier. I really am. My doctor's like, "Eat the rainbow." So I'm at the grocery store, and I see beets. And I think, "Yeah, beets. Earthy. Full of antioxidants. I'm a sophisticated adult, I can handle a beet."

But here's the thing they don't tell you about beets. They're the only food that comes with a 24-hour-later psychological horror film.

_(Pauses, lets that sink in)_

You eat the beets, you feel great, you feel virtuous. Then the next morning, you go to the bathroom... you do your business... you look down... and for one, brief, terrifying second... you think you're dying.

_(Eyes go wide)_

Your life flashes before your eyes. You're like, "THIS IS IT! My appendix finally exploded! I knew I shouldn't have tried that parkour class!" You're mentally writing your will on a piece of toilet paper. "To my cat, I leave everything. Just... don't eat the plants."

And then... just as you're about to call an ambulance and confess all your secrets to a 911 operator... you remember.

"Oh, wait... I had that salad... with the... purple things..."

Beets are the only food that can make you feel like you're starring in an episode of _ER_, only to have the big reveal be... "Diagnosis: You ate a vegetable." It's the most anti-climactic medical drama of all time. They should come with a warning label: "Contents may cause you to question your own mortality. Don't worry, it's just the beets. You're fine. Probably."
